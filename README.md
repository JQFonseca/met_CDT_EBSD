# met_CDT_EBSD

This is the repository for the Research Software Engineering module of the CDT. 

## Aim of the unit and of the assignment

The aim of the this course is to learn about modern software engineering practice, particularly to learn about python, version control and colaborating on code development using the GitHub workflow.

As a group, you should develop a programme for plotting orientations from an EBSD data file using:

- a color coded map
- a color coded pole figure

this is an extension of what you already did using Matlab with Brad Wynne in semester 1. You should extend that work to include at least:

- ability to handle hexagonal materials (Ti, Mg, Zr)
- documentation
- examples
- a test case (maybe compare it to an mtex output)

Add any further unctionality as you wish.

Marks will be allocated based on the numnber and quality of your contributions as tracked by github [Pull Requests](https://github.com/JQFonseca/met_CDT_EBSD/pulls) and by your participation in discussions, as recorded in [Issues](https://github.com/JQFonseca/met_CDT_EBSD/issues).
